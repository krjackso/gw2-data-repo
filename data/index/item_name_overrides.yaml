# Manual semantic name→ID mappings for wiki names that differ from API names
# These override the auto-generated item_names.yaml entries
#
# Common use cases:
# - Armor weight variants: wiki uses "(heavy)", "(medium)", "(light)" suffixes
# - Rarity variants: when items share a name but differ by rarity (Exotic/Ascended/Legendary)
#   The LLM adds rarity qualifiers like "(Ascended)" to disambiguate
# - Alternative wiki terminology that differs from API item names
# - Disambiguation for items with semantic context
#
# Format: 'exact wiki name': itemId (single integer, not a list)
#
# To find the correct item ID:
# 1. Search the item_names.yaml index for candidate IDs
# 2. Check wiki or GW2 API to confirm which ID is correct
# 3. Add the mapping here
#
# Rarity qualifiers:
# When the LLM encounters items with multiple rarity variants on the wiki, it will
# automatically append the rarity in parentheses (e.g., "Item Name (Ascended)").
# Add these qualified names here to map them to the correct item IDs.
